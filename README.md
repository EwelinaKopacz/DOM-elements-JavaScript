# JavaScript DOM Elements Project

My second project in JavaScript. Using existing code, I had to add two functionality like:

1. Tooltip - there are two type of tooltip, text and image
2. Table of content - based on an array of object

I couldn't modify HTML code.
I added solutions only in JS file.

* creating function for repetitive elements like:
    * function to create: a, span, ul, li tags and function to change innerText.
* creating and using ifâ€¦else Statements in JS,
* using: forEach() and filter() methods,
* using objects in array.
