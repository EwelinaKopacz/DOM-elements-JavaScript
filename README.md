# Project JS DOM ELEMENTS

My second project in JavaScript. Using existing code, I had to add two functionality like:

1. Tooltip - there are two type of tooltip, text and image
2. Table of content - based on an array of objects

I couldn't modify HTML code. 
I added solutions only in JS file.

## Technologies:

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Solutions
Creating this project I had a opportunity to practice:
* creating and adding new elements in HTML with appropriate attributes using only JS
* creating function for repetitive elements like: 
    * function to create: a, span, ul, li tags and function to change innerText.
* creating and using ifâ€¦else Statements in JS 
* using: forEach() and filter() methods 
* using objects in array
